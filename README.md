## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In doing this project, I have learned that you can actually use the CSS calc() function inside of arbitrary values in tailwind. To do so, you just have to type calc() inside of a square bracket. Make sure that there's no empty spaces inside of the parenthesis.

```html
<div class="w-[calc(100vw-100)]">Some div</div>
```

If you want to have spaces inside of the parenthesis, you can add underscores as spaces.

```html
<div class="w-[calc(100vw_-_100)]">Some div</div>
```
